Images http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/SIP/images/blcam/blcam_01.fit through blcam_21.fit are images of the field around the "ultra-fast" cepheid variable star BL Cam.

Each exposure is 30 seconds long. The date and time of the observation (in the FITS header) are the beginning of the exposure in Universal Time (UT).
